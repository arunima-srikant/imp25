      "answer": "It was an opportunistic decision. A Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) outlet down the road shut down in Oct/Nov 2021. We saw the gap and launched in December 2021. Originally, Nuvola Gelato was supposed to launch first, but we swapped the timeline to capitalize on the CCD closure.",

      "question": "Why the name 'Coffee Craft' vs 'Nuvola'?",
      "answer": "For the cafe, we wanted a name that was 'in your face' so people knew exactly what it was (Coffee). For the ice cream brand, we chose 'Nuvola' (or Ola) to generate curiosity, as the name doesn't immediately reveal the product, prompting people to investigate.",

      "answer": "We used an English Phone Booth design for the entrance to create a sense of privacy. Inside, we used soothing colors (black, white, wood) and a giant undisturbed glass window to allow natural sunlight, avoiding loud neon colors to encourage focus.",

      "question": "Why did you switch to a live kitchen?",
      "answer": "We noticed customers would work for hours but leave to eat lunch elsewhere because we only had display food. We shifted to a 'Live Kitchen' making fresh food to order and removed the display cabinet to retain customers for meals.",

      "question": "Why is coffee marketing unique?",
      "answer": "Coffee is an 'addictive game' like alcohol. Once a customer adjusts to your specific ratios and taste, they find it hard to switch. This creates high stickiness, meaning if you win one customer, you likely win their social circle too.",

      "question": "What is the strategy behind the wallet recharge?",
      "answer": "We offer a 20% bonus (pay 1000, get 1200). Psychologically, when a customer has money locked in our wallet, they are compelled to visit us even if they are passing a competitor, because they feel they have 'already paid' for the coffee.",

      "answer": "We use Zomato for data analytics. Our data shows a 70% repeat customer rate, which is exceptionally high. We also track wallet recharge frequency, which confirms customers are committing to long-term patronage (e.g., 40 years of work).",

      "answer": "Humor works best. We did a reel about 'trust issues' where the barista holds the coffee until the payment goes through. We also jumped on the trend of 'coffee made by a 5-year-old' featuring an actual child in the kitchen.",

      "answer": "I respect Nandan Coffee (London Coffee in transcript, corrected by notes) for their consistency. I find Subko good but 'confusing' because they have too many things going on, making it unclear if they are a cafe or a merchandise store.",
