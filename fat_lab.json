    "question": "How would you describe the cafe situation in India today?",
    "answer": "Cafe culture in India differs between cities. In Pune, people prefer food along with coffee, unlike Bangalore where coffee itself is central. Pune’s cafes combine both food and beverages, and specialty coffee culture is slowly growing across India as part of the third wave.",

    "question": "Have you noticed any patterns across cafes in India in terms of menu, decor, or outreach?",
    "answer": "Most cafes now offer manual brewing and sell coffee beans, but the trend is shifting toward food. Many cafes adopt a minimalist, earthy decor with greys and browns and spaces for remote work. We intentionally avoid that; we want people to interact rather than work, which is why we don’t offer Wi-Fi.",
