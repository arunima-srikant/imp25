      "question": "What sparked the idea for Korebi?",
      "answer": "It started in 2016 from a lack of good coffee on campus. My husband's apartment mates were from South India and brewed good coffee, which inspired the interest. It was organic and stemmed purely from a desire for better coffee, not initially as a business plan.",

      "answer": "We opened cafés primarily for branding and customer acquisition for our e-commerce and B2B businesses. The e-commerce market is crowded, making customer acquisition costs high. Physical locations allow us to acquire customers without high ad spend.",

      "answer": "Students in universities are a captive audience for 3-4 years. If they drink Korebi regularly during college, they become familiar with the brand. When they graduate, they are likely to buy our coffee for their homes, giving us long-term value with near-zero acquisition cost.",
