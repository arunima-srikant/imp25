      "answer": "I hold a BSc in Chemistry (topped in 12th grade) and an MBA in Marketing. I come from a strong educational background. When I first told my father I wanted to be a chef in 1992, he looked down on it, asking if I wanted to be a 'cook', as hotel management was only a diploma then. He insisted I complete my graduation first.",

      "answer": "Initially, there was no set menu. It was person-dependent. Customers would say they were hungry, and I would open the fridge and cook whatever was available. We standardized this later because staff couldn't replicate my spontaneous cooking.",

      "answer": "Pune is a saturated market and the customer base is conservative regarding spend and taste. They don't value quality easily. However, areas like Kothrud are evolving because the well-educated Marathi crowd there travels often (e.g., to Germany) and is now stepping out more.",
