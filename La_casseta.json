      "question": "How did your first venture, Toss, specifically start?",
      "answer": "I started Toss in 2021 as a cloud kitchen in a vacant garage in my society. I initially considered white-labeling flash-frozen food from Palghar but decided to create my own recipes instead.",

      "answer": "I handled the kitchen entirely by myself for one year with no staff, except for a friend who managed the counter and design. It was a learning ground where we experimented, eventually even producing our own mozzarella cheese.",

      "question": "What makes La Casetta different from other cafes?",
      "answer": "La Casetta is my passion project. Unlike the common 'boho' theme in Pune, I wanted a different experience. Everything is handmade—from the pastas and doughs to the paint on the walls. We use heirloom recipes from Italian households that aren't found in standard restaurants.",

      "answer": "I filter by three factors: spending capacity, age group, and taste. For example, NIBM has an Anglo-Indian population, while student areas like FC Road differ from Prabhat Road. Spending capacity is the primary driver.",

      "question": "Why did you choose this specific logo and color palette?",
      "answer": "La Casetta means 'Little House'. We chose a retro font and a burgundy color palette to evoke the 60s and 70s era. We avoided 3D text in favor of a painted look to maintain a minimal, European, and nostalgic feel.",

      "question": "Why don't you use a marketing agency?",
      "answer": "Agencies often apply a generic 'A-B-C-D' approach to every brand. They don't offer the specific vision or crowd filtration I need. I prefer in-house marketing to ensure the brand's unique voice is maintained.",

      "answer": "No. Trends like Boba tea or Matcha create hype, but hype dies out. I focus on long-term conversion through genuine experience rather than short-term viral trends.",

      "question": "How should a bootstrapped cafe allocate budget?",
      "answer": "Do not spend more than 10% on marketing. Invest the majority (30-40%) in the kitchen, equipment, and staff training. A good product builds the brand slowly but surely.",

      "question": "What were the biggest hurdles in opening?",
      "answer": "Financial bottlenecks due to civil work delays were the biggest issue. Labor timelines often shift, which increases rental burdens and salary costs if staff is hired but the place isn't ready.",

      "question": "Why do you use tungsten lights instead of LEDs?",
      "answer": "LEDs have a frequency that can feel harsh and induce anxiety. Tungsten filaments provide a full light spectrum that is warmer and more soothing, creating the 'feel' I wanted, not just the 'look'.",

      "answer": "There is a bias where customers remember the last thing they ate. If the 5-course meal is good but the dessert is bad, the whole experience is nullified.",
